## 📚 Concepts Learned

### 1. Printing to the Console

The `print()` function is the most basic command. It tells the computer to output something to the screen.

- **Strings:** Text in Python must be enclosed in double quotes `""` or single quotes `''`.
- **Syntax Error:** Occurs when you break the rules of the language (e.g., forgetting a closing quote).

```python
# Standard print
print("Hello World!")

# Common Error: SyntaxError (Missing quote)
# print("Hello World)

2. String Manipulation 
We can manipulate how strings appear using special characters and concatenation.

New Line (\n): Creates a line break inside a single string.

Concatenation (+): Merges two separate strings into one.

```python
# Printing on multiple lines
print("Hello world!\nHello world!\nHello world!")

# String Concatenation (combining strings)
print("Hello" + " " + "Angela")

⚠️ Warning - IndentationError: Python is sensitive to whitespace. Do not add spaces or tabs at the start of a line unless you are inside a block of code (like a function or loop).
